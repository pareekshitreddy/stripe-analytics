# Stripe Analytics

This repository contains the `stripe-analytics` project, developed as part of the [dbt Fundamentals course](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/dbt-fundamentals) by dbt Labs. The project demonstrates the application of dbt (data build tool) for transforming and analyzing Stripe payment data.

## Project Overview

The `stripe-analytics` project showcases the following dbt features:

- **Models**: SQL files that define transformations to raw Stripe data, creating clean and analysis-ready datasets.
- **Sources**: Definitions of raw data sources, enabling source freshness checks and documentation.
- **Tests**: Built-in and custom tests to ensure data quality and integrity.
- **Snapshots**: Capture and track changes in slowly changing dimensions over time.
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation for models and sources, enhancing project transparency.

## Getting Started

To explore this project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pareekshitreddy/stripe-analytics.git
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:

   Ensure you have dbt installed. If not, follow the installation guide in the [official dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation).

3. **Configure the profile**:

   Update the `profiles.yml` file with your data warehouse connection details. Refer to the [dbt profile setup guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile) for assistance.

4. **Install dependencies**:

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   dbt deps
   ```

5. **Run dbt commands**:

   - Compile models:

     ```bash
     dbt compile
     ```

   - Execute models:

     ```bash
     dbt run
     ```

   - Run tests:

     ```bash
     dbt test
     ```

   - Generate documentation:

     ```bash
     dbt docs generate
     ```

   - Serve documentation locally:

     ```bash
     dbt docs serve
     ```
